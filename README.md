# WebLIFX

A simple web client for your LIFX bulbs.

### # How?

You paste your account's access token from LIFX's account settings and the app then consumes the LIFX API.

### # Why?

Because I did not want to grab my phone everytime I needed to adjust the lights. I wanted to open a tab in my browser, change them and go back to what I was doing.
